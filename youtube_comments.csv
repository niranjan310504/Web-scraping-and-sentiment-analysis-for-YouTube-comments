Love the recap. I forgot about some of these gems.
I thought it was the end of the year for a second
9:19 the bird that caught a banger earworm that stuck in its head till the morning it had to get out. And now it can't be stopped. It's just too catchy.  Gets me every time
"9:23 got me dying for two reasons:
1. the bird was singing so happily
2. the way she was like SILENCE!!"
"6:34 If that happened to me, I don't even think I could bring myself to be mad about it. That fish earned his freedom."
"I love the cop one so much. The officer yelling out ""There's a cop right next to you!"" Then the biker IMMEDIATELY tapping the helmet. That's comedy."
"That ""AMAZON"" was personal-
4:45"
"7:55 shushes ""im having a convorsation"" dog: sings butifully"
"Is it a coincidence that the best of 2024 came out the same day as the solar eclipse, a major 2024 event"
0:39 was a gold moment with that egg. Perfect placement and timing.
2:23 ... That was the best oooooohhhmmmm I've ever heard. So zen.
"1:34 If it wasn't filmed they would've been like ""uh huh suuuuure you fell"""
Istg I can't get over the mom telling her kid to use both his eyes  0:45
6:30 bro the dog is straight from hell
"My mandarin teacher played this in class today and it was one of the first videos my class actually paid attention to and not completely talk over, I just wanna say thanks."
"The pug screaming like a human child killed me.

Okay, maybe something is wrong with me because the DoorDash guy screaming when he saw the cat cracked me up too. I guess screaming in fear is hilarious to me.

I'm not totally broken because the lady screaming at the bear did not make me laugh. Phew."
I rewatch your old ones fairly regularly. So yes anything you put out we will watch. Keep up the good work brother
"3:58 He did not want to drive
(WHY IS THE WHIMPERING SO CUTE)"
1:34 That baby really did just tell his dad to shut up.
“Is that god?” Had me dying 2:02
9:26 that Bird passed the vibe check
"I love how in 3:20 when he fell, he just accepted his fate"
"9:29 the bird really continued like saying ""I~ don care!"""
"2:41 ""There's a cop next to you"""
7:56 that singing dog is literally me in the car all the time
"Yes please, Jason; more of these compilations every quarter year or so would be fab. Thank you"
7:40 I would vote for him.
"yes, defiantly keep the recaps coming! I found your channel years ago and I'm so very glad you're still making videos."
This channel ALWAYS lives up to expectations. NEVER has clickbait.  Great content.  Thank you!
I've been in a horrible mood for no reason all day and nothing has been able to cheer me up except this. Thank you so much
1:43 that’s a terrible day if I’ve ever seen one
"“Use both of your eyes” 
That cat needed to us both its ears 5:52"
You can tell it’s been a crazy year if daily dose is already doing this
6:40 I absolutely LOST it LMAOOO WHY DID IT DO THAT
7:45 that dog looks so proud
I've seen the clip several times before at 9:43 and could still see it over and over and over. Pure joy for sure!
The cardboard art is probably one of the most impressive thing I've ever seen
7:47 he would definitely get my vote
5:32 Average episode of Tom and Jerry
"0:36
That one got me dead, bro said, say less"
"The Earth, Wind, and Fire whistling September is by far the BEST ALL YEAR.

That bird is getting it!!!!!!!"
7:09 Bro said sit when the dog was already sitting.
9:10 she's crying as if the bird assaulted her
"If anyone didn’t know, cats practically don’t hunt rats. Their diet in the wild consists of small birds (tits, sparrows, pigeons, crows and the like) and small rodents (mostly mice). Rats can even grow to a size larger than cats and, as a rule, do not walk alone, plus they are very brave and vicious in front of their enemies, even if the size of the enemy is very much larger than their own. Cats do not hunt rats out of a good life, that is, only in cases when there is nothing else to eat."
"4:09 “Yo what’s this box doing here?”

Press Shift to run"
"9:53 I love how the dog is like: 
I did it! 
OMG i did it!
OMG did you see that!
That was amazing!"""
"the bird at 9:15 was whistling ""September"", by Earth, Wind & Fire. nice choice."
4:36 AMAZON️
"6:35  I love how the other dog looks like he’s asking for help
“he’s behind me isn’t he”
Something happened to the time stamp so the new one is 6:23"
The dog at 2:38 shows how fast a dog goes from happy to mad to sleepy in a matter of seconds
"7:57
This definitely isn't a video from 2024, I distinctly remember seeing it a number of years ago.
Absolute gold though, I'll rewatch it any day."
"0:12
THE WAY THE DOG SCREAMED LIKE A HUMAN AT THE END KILLED ME"
8:22 sandman seem to be doing well since Spiderman 3
"7:14 smart kid, already knew what was gonna happen"
"4:23 ""Do not attempt"" Where the hell should I get a Fighter jet from !?"
0:50“Use both your eyes”
"The boy, who fell from the stairs and push the alarm, LOL the shelf was like I am out of here  @ 1:40 min"
"Damnnnn the way that bear peeled around that corner and all I saw was eyes for a second. Shit, granny, I'm screaming too"
"9:47 The dog really knew he could do it, so he d i d."
3:16 that trick was slick
5:37 the cat and the mouse switched roles
1:10 - the goat is his spirit animal.
7:45 that cat had speed like Sonic the Hedgehog
6:22 my anxiety killed me
7:50 that dog got talent
6:55 I wonder what it's like to be that talented.

Falling and hitting the fire alarm… that’s so me. ️
3:40 That plane is gonna head to Mars
"3:53 he isn’t on earth bro, he’s in space"
"After chasing that eclipse all day, this was a great way to unwind, totally needed this today, thank you very much @ Daily Dose Of Internet."
It's always nice to have more of your fun in a longer row.
9:38 What bees say: go away.
6:50 ..... awesome art.
"6:35
That dog is probably satan.."
The creativity that goes into cardboard art blows me away.  I can't begin to imagine how it's done. I love it!
4:00 drivers anxiety
"3:09 He is trying to say ""Subscribe to DDOS and like the vids"""
"9:05 reminds me of when my mom wanted a Caesar salad and the person said, 

""chicken sandwich?”"
The firealarm beep at 0:44 killed me
5:02 darn porch pirates!
The bird singing at 7 am is just my vibe!
"9:19 
This little man makes me happier than happy and I have no idea why
he just sounds so happy"
2:00 the tone in which she said that is just priceless
"Yes, love the top montages, for sure. Would like to see more.  Thank you!"
1:37 damn that slap echoed
"2:10 damn, that lat-drop is insane"
That scream from the pug made me rewind like 20 times I’m dieing!
2:20 that cat definitly could be a great WWE wrestler with that takedown
9:00 that guy doesn’t look human
The snoring one was so real! (1:29). Thanks for this!
That cardboard Art is amazing
"Really cool idea! If you decide to keep making this kind of videos, then they will be like a very concentrated delicious syrup - a compilation of best memes over the course of some time span, really nice. Also would like to use this comment (because I don't write as many of those) to communicate my immense appreciation for the quality of the haha-videos you find online - you are the only channel on YouTube whose every single compilation consists of exclusively amusing(and interesting) videos. Amazing work<3"
just in case if we don’t have a 2025
The scream at the end of the pogo stick one lol
"8:55 This is how Machamp would punch, I'd imagine."
"This is a brilliant compilation!  Thank you.  I always watch your vids, subbed about nine years ago,  vids are always good.  Well done."
3:34 I don’t know if yall heard that but I think that cat maniacally laughed
These were great  Thanks for sharing!
2:57 fear unlocked: Tablecloths
1:47 to this day i still wonder why that thing in the front just took off
9:55 - This reminded me of the Deepwater Horizon movie sort of
The dog shrieking gets me every time
"Yes, I enjoyed it and would like to see more like this in the future! Thanks ️"
Thank you for this. My Dad passed away a week ago and I have really needed a laugh.
3:13 I have no clue what he's saying but I 100% agree.
The dog one cracked me up
3:26 the life was just taken away from him
this video healed me
"Fantastic! I rarely see your videos these days, don’t know why YouTube doesn’t suggest you, you’re always putting great content!"
2:16 best ASMR ever
6:02 Poor dude was rethinking about his whole life in those seconds
That was really fun to watch. It would be great to get more of these Best-of-compilations!
5:20 oh y'all wanted a twist eh
"9:31 yes talk to us as in get the fuck away lol
It’s their defence mechanisms if anyone wanted to know"

5:24 is the funniest shit I've seen all week. Thank you.
Seeing so much love here is beautiful. God bless you all!
6:16 -  I ain't no vegan bro!
"That amazing Japanease art!! I was so close to visiting it one point myself. I had experience with modeling and in late 2015 I was in contact with Capcom about the facial likeness role of Leon for the Resident Evil 2 Remake. I failed to mention I also have a voice acting background, in the end I lost the part and I can't forgive myself for wasting such an opportunity to visit Japan..."
Wow 10:25 is so talented
One of your best collections. The poor guy with the glass table. He was being so careful and it shattered so completely. It didn't seem real. Also liked the woman getting attacked by the bed.
"This was an awesome reminder. 
I just love that birdie at 7 am :D"

You actually surprised me when you made a best of 2024 in April
"I support and like videos like this. I like reddit. but seeing the best of a year's worth of videos summarised here saves you a lot of time and effort.
Greetings from Germany"
"YES! ""Quarterly Dose Of Internet""! Love it!"
"This was hilarious.  Yes please, more like this DDOI.  Thank you."
The birds were trying to fuse 0:02
Hilarious - just the dull sort of morning when I needed a really good laugh!  Thanks.
"Dont worry guys, DDOI has just finally become powerful enough to create his own calendar system where the new year starts in April. 

Happy New Years, everyone!"

Great job on the video! It was both entertaining and educational.
